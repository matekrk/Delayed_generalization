# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = EnhancedTrainingAnalyzer(num_classes=10, max_examples_track=1000)

# In your training loop:
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # ... your training code ...
    
    # Track comprehensive dynamics
    analyzer.track_epoch(model, train_loader, test_loader, criterion, epoch, optimizer)
    
    # Generate plots periodically
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        analyzer.plot_accuracy_evolution()
        analyzer.plot_difficulty_evolution()
        analyzer.plot_opposing_signals()

# Generate comprehensive report
analyzer.generate_comprehensive_report("./analysis_results")
```

### Option 2: Integration with Existing Unified Notebook

1. **Add imports to your notebook:**
```python
from enhanced_analysis_features import EnhancedTrainingAnalyzer
```

2. **Replace the existing tracker initialization:**
```python
# Use comprehensive tracking:
analyzer = EnhancedTrainingAnalyzer(num_classes=10, max_examples_track=1000)
```

3. **Update your training loop:**
```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # ... existing training code ...
    
    # Add comprehensive tracking:
    analyzer.track_epoch(model, train_loader, test_loader, criterion, epoch, optimizer)
```

4. **Generate comprehensive visualizations:**
```python
# All the comprehensive features are available:
analyzer.plot_difficulty_evolution()          # Difficulty over time
analyzer.plot_accuracy_evolution()            # Separate train/test with class breakdown  
analyzer.plot_opposing_signals()              # Opposing pairs + loss changes
analyzer.create_enhanced_animation("./anim.gif")  # Bar plot animations
```

## üé® Visualization Examples

- **Class-wise difficulty trends** - Per-class difficulty progression
- **Forgetting events distribution** - Histogram of how often examples are forgotten

    max_examples_track=1000            # Maximum examples to track individually
)
```

### Animation Customization
```python
anim = analyzer.create_enhanced_animation(
    save_path="./enhanced_training.gif",
    fps=10                             # Frames per second
